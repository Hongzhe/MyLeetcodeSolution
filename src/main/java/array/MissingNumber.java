/**
 * Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n],
 * return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.
 *
 * Follow up: Could you implement a solution using only O(1) extra space complexity and O(n) runtime complexity?
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: nums = [3,0,1]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3].
 * 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * n == nums.length
 * 1 <= n <= 104
 * 0 <= nums[i] <= n
 * All the numbers of nums are unique.
